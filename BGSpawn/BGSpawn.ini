Description = BGSpawn is a new system who handles "Spawned creatures" appearing in Baldur's Gate areas. The mod changes the random (but fixed) creatures u may find around the sword coast (called spawns) with a completely new and challenging system. As an option, u may also install a new creature "Vampiric Wolf Lord" (based on DavidW Ulcaster Wolf). NOTE: Vampiric Wolf Lord (inspired to DavidW Wolf of Ulcaster) changes some Vampiric Wolf in the game. It's used by BGSpawn-system.
